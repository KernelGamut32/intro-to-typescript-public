# Introduction to TypeScript - Lab 10

Execute the exercises at https://www.learningtypescript.com/declaration-files/ including:

## Global Travels

* Step #1: Passport Declarations
* Step #2: Unexpected Methods

## Type Illusions

GitHub repository defined for the exercises (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/declaration-files) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
