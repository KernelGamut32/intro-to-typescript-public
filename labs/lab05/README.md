Execute the exercises at https://www.learningtypescript.com/functions/ including:

GitHub repository defined for the exercises (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/functions) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
