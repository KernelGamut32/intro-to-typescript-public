# Introduction to TypeScript - Lab 09

Execute the exercises at https://www.learningtypescript.com/type-modifiers/ including:

## Modifiers of the Types

* Step #1: Fabulous Secret Powers
* Step #2: Artifact Assertions

## Type Force

GitHub repository defined for the exercises (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/type-modifiers) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
