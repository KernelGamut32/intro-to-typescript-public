# Introduction to TypeScript - Lab 03

Execute the exercises at https://www.learningtypescript.com/unions-and-literals/ including:

## Primitive Cooking

* Step #1: Ingredients
* Step #2: Recipes
* Step #3: Seating

## The Narrow Trail

GitHub repository defined for the exercises (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/unions-and-literals) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
