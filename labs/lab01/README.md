# Introduction to TypeScript - Lab 01

Execute the exercise at https://www.learningtypescript.com/from-javascript-to-typescript including:

## The Typeinator

* Step #1: Prototypes to Classes
* Step #2: Callbacks to Async Await

GitHub repository defined for the exercise (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/from-javascript-to-typescript) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
