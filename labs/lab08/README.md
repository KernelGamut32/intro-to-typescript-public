Execute the exercises at https://www.learningtypescript.com/classes/ including:

## Classifying Creatures

* Step #1: Polly Parrot's Properties

* Step #3: Hamster Helpers

## The Shape of Types

GitHub repository defined for the exercises (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/classes) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
