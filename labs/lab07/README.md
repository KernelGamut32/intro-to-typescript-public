# Introduction to TypeScript - Lab 07

Execute the exercises at https://www.learningtypescript.com/interfaces/ including:

## Vacation Planning

* Step #1: Cities
* Step #2: Restaurants
* Step #3: Landmarks

## Playlist Soundness

GitHub repository defined for the exercises (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/interfaces) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
