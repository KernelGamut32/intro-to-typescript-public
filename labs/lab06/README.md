# Introduction to TypeScript - Lab 06

Execute the exercises at https://www.learningtypescript.com/arrays/ including:

## Analyzing DNA

* Step #1: Shallow Equality
* Step #2: Shallow Differences
* Step #3: Deep Equality
* Step #4: Deep Differences

## Text Processor

GitHub repository defined for the exercises (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/arrays) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
