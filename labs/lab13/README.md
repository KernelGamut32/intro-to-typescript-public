# Introduction to TypeScript - Lab 13

Execute the exercises at https://www.learningtypescript.com/syntax-extensions/ including:

## Typespeare

* Step #1: What's in a Namespace?
* Step #2: Much Ado About Enums
* Step #3: Typus Andronicus

GitHub repository defined for the exercises (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/syntax-extensions) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
