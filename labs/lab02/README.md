# Introduction to TypeScript - Lab 02

Execute the exercise at https://www.learningtypescript.com/the-type-system/ including:

## System of a Clown

* Step #1: Clowning Around
* Step #2: Clown Availability

GitHub repository defined for the exercise (https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects/tree/main/projects/the-type-system) contains the solutions as well. I would recommend forking the top-level repository and cloning from the fork rather than cloning directly.
